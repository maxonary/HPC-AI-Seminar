# The new Frontier in HPC and AI
Lecture presentation by Addison Snell, CEO of Intersect360 Research - July 2024

MBA at Kellogg in 1997
Silicon Graphics, IDC, and founder of Intersect 360 Research

## Introduction
High Performance Computing (HPC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are converging. The new frontier is the intersection of these two technologies.

AI and HPC were separate fields for a long time. HPC has been used for scientific computing, simulations, and modeling. Now also for training and running GenAI models.

## Why the Convergence? - Some historical context
- **Data**: AI needs a lot of data to train models. HPC can provide the computational power to process this data.

Comparison of AIâ€™s current impact to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s.
AI seems to be the **trend** right now. Before it Cloud Computing, Blockchain, Big Data, Web 2.0. 
AI is the new buzzword.

## What else is HPC used for?
- **HPC** mainly used for simulations, modeling, and scientific computing.
- **Supercomputers** for weather forecasting, climate modeling, and nuclear simulations, but also for **cyberattacks** - not cybersecurity. Many countries have supercomputers for cyberattacks.
- **Market sectors**: Finance, oil and gas, manufacturing, agricultural engineering, healthcare, pharmacology, gene research, and automotive.

## Problems of HPC
- **Energy consumption**: systems consume significant power, posing an energy paradox - not only studying climate change but contributing to it.

- **Business model**: HPC is expensive, and the business model is not sustainable. Computers are said obsolete withing 4 years of usage. 

## What to use AI for?
Consider Data Gender Bias driven decisions are illegal. This is an AIs major weakspot.

It can still help in:
- Reducing human latency - the AI can make calculations and decisions faster than humans
- Reducing human error - humans make mistakes, AI can be more accurate
- Idea delivery to maintain a long-term quality lead over the competition
- Everyday science - Like the development of **Tide Pods**, dissolving only in water and not by the inside liquid, or reshaping **Pringles** flying off the production line due to aerodynamic

## Stance on NVIDIA and the competition
Nvidia is the Dotcom AOL of today. Providing fast GPUs for AI and HPC, but this will only uphold with the LLM trend.

**Google and Microsoft TPU** - Main competitors at a vertical level
AI as a service 

**Key Takeaways**: 
- AI and HPC are converging
- Energy consumption is a problem
- AI can help reduce human latency and error
- AI can help maintain a long-term quality lead over the competition
- Nvidia is the Dotcom AOL of today
- Google and Microsoft are main competitors at a vertical level

Also: Look for most common things first - so does the opposite 
Horses not Zebras

Doctors are taught to consider the most common diagnoses before considering rare diseases. It suggests that when encountering an issue or analyzing data, it's more practical to first consider and address the common and probable patterns before exploring more rare or complex explanations for what's happening.
