# Infiniband 
Presentation by Steve Jones at Stanford HPC August 5th 2024

## What is Infiniband?
Infiniband is a high-speed network technology that is used to connect servers and storage systems. It is a **high-performance, low-latency** network that is used in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. It is designed to provide high bandwidth and low latency, making it ideal for applications that require high-speed data transfer.

Outperforms Ethernet and Fibre Channel in terms of bandwidth and latency. Ethernet has a higher latency due to protocol complexity and additional processing steps. 

Infiniband is a **point-to-point** network, meaning that each device is connected directly to another device. This allows for high-speed data transfer between devices without the need for a central switch or router.

## Subnet Manager
Routers: Infiniband routers are used to connect multiple Infiniband networks together. They are used to route data between different networks and provide a high-speed connection between servers and storage systems.

Subnet Managers: Configures the local subnet and ensures coninous operation. There must be at least one subnet manager present to manage initialisation and reconfiguration of the network once it goes online.

## Infiniband Topologies
- **Point-to-Point**: Direct connection between two devices.
- **Switched**: Multiple devices connected to a central switch.
- **Hybrid**: Combination of point-to-point and switched topologies.
- **LID**: Local Identifier, unique identifier for each device on the network.
- **Fabric**: Collection of switches and devices connected together.
- **Fabric Manager**: Manages the Infiniband fabric and provides configuration and management services.
